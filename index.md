### CPSC 120

* Lab 9, Part 2

    This lab was very interesting and fun to work on. This lab focused on the creation of a program that fixed spelling errors in a document file. While taking this class, I began to think more deeply about technology and the software; the topic of identifying errors was one topic that intrigued me the most. 

* Lab 3, Part 1

    Lab 3 was one of my favorite labs because it was the lab that really propelled my enjoyment for coding. This labâ€™s objective was to create a BMI calculator that a user could use to input their height and weight. Being able to create a program that got a user's input and outputted something precise was very rewarding. 

* Lab 4, Part 1

    Again, this lab made me really enjoy and have fun with coding. When I can create a program that takes a user's input, and gives the user useful information that is convenient to them, they tend to be my favorites. Using math to get an output you wouldn't normally obtain is a topic I look forward to in the future.
